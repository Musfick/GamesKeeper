## Tech stack & Open-source libraries

- 100% [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- [BaseActivity](https://github.com/Musfick/GamesKeeper/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/foxhole/gameskeeper/base/BaseActivity.kt) - for activity code reuse.
- [BaseFragment](https://github.com/Musfick/GamesKeeper/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/foxhole/gameskeeper/base/BaseFragment.kt) - for fragment code reuse.
- [BaseRecyclerViewAdapter](https://github.com/Musfick/GamesKeeper/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/foxhole/gameskeeper/base/BaseRecyclerViewAdapter.kt) - for recyclerview code reuse.
- [BaseDao](https://github.com/Musfick/GamesKeeper/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/foxhole/gameskeeper/base/BaseDao.kt) - for dao code reuse.
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) (alpha) for dependency injection.üó°Ô∏è
- JetPacküöÄ
  - View Binding - View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  - LiveData - notify domain layer data to views.
  - Lifecycle - dispose of observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
  - Room Persistence - construct a database using the abstract layer.
  - DataStore - dataStore uses Kotlin, Coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously with consistency and transaction support üòç
  - Advanced Navigation Component - bottom navigation with navigation component
  - Paging 3 - paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network.
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation.
- [coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - an image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [okhttp-logging-interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - logs HTTP request and response data.
- [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines,provides `runBlocking` coroutine builder used in tests
- [Youtube Player](https://github.com/PierfrancescoSoffritti/android-youtube-player) - android-youtube-player is a stable and customizable open source YouTube player for Android.
- [jsoup](https://jsoup.org/download) - jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML
